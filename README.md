This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project integrated with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) / [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Getting Started

After you cloned this repo. You should do the following:

```bash
bundle && yarn
```

First, run the development server with command defined inside Procfile.dev and execute by foreman ( you can use overmind too ):

```bash
bin/dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the Rails welcome screen.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the NextJS welcome screen.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
